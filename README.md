# 🧹 Customer Call List Data Cleaning using Python (Pandas)

This project demonstrates how to clean and preprocess a **Customer Call List** dataset using **Python** and **Pandas**. The goal is to make the dataset ready for analysis by removing duplicates, cleaning phone numbers, fixing inconsistent values, and handling missing data — and finally saving the cleaned file as a CSV.
